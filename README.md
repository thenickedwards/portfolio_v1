# portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! First of all thank you for being so thorough as to check out the readme! You must be good at your job and thorough to boot. I think we'll work well together!

This portoflio began as a Week 2 homework assignment in coding bootcamp. All the images and links were mere placeholders for the awesomeness to come.  A few weeks later and the site is beginning to take shape as a place to share my work, contact info, and a little about myself. There's more work to do and I'm ready for it.

Here's a look back at the requirements for each assignment.
Week 2 accepatance criteria listed in [W2-hw_README.md](W2-hw_README.md).
Week 8 accepatance criteria listed in [W8-hw_README.md](W8-hw_README.md).
