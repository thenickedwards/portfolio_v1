# portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! First of all thank you for being so thorough as to check out the readme! You must be good at your job. I think we'll work well together!

This portfolio began as a Week 2 homework assignment in coding bootcamp. All the images and links were mere placeholders for the awesomeness to come.  A few weeks later and the site is beginning to take shape as a place to share my work, contact info, and a little about myself. There's more work to do and I'm ready for it.

Here's a look back at the requirements for each assignment.

Week 2 acceptance criteria listed in [W2-hw_README.md](/z-archive/W2-hw_README.md).

Week 8 acceptance criteria listed in [W8-hw_README.md](/z-archive/W8-hw_README.md).

Week 16 acceptance criteria listed in [W16-hw_README.md](/z-archive/W16-hw_README.md).
